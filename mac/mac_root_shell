Or the default shell of any user for that matter. I don’t know if this is recommended or not, but changing from /bin/sh to /bin/bash will enable tab-completion, and since I’m a lazy admin that’s what I’ll do. (Plus, less keystrokes = longer hardware life for my keyboard.)

This command will display the user’s default shell (replace root with desired username):

rivendell:~ root# dscl . -read /Users/root UserShell
Now change the shell (in this case to /bin/bash):

rivendell:~ root# dscl . -change /Users/root UserShell /bin/sh /bin/bash
Make sure it was changed:

rivendell:~ root# dscl . -read /Users/root UserShell
UserShell: /bin/bash
rivendell:~ root# echo $0
-sh
rivendell:~ root# su -
rivendell:~ root# echo $0
-bash
